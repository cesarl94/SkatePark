# Skate Park

### First implementation of the character
The first 4 hours of development. In that time I've implemented:
* Added a generic map from unreal marketplace (optmized to be uploaded here in GitHub)
* Added Core classes, including GameMode, PlayerController and Character
* Character uses a generic 3D model from Mixamo
* Added AnimationBlueprint with a simple Mixamo idle animation
* Added Enhanced Input System
* Added camera control with the mouse
* Added an impulse when you press up
